<p>This past week, we all bore witness to the brutal murders of FOUR Black men by police—Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Delrawn Smalls, and Alva Braziel.1 And guess what? The federal government has been bankrolling the police departments that killed all four of them.
Yes. Congress and the Obama administration are spending millions of dollars every year giving grants to the same police departments that are killing and over-incarcerating Black people--and it has to stop.</p>

	
	<p>If you vote for me I'll stop all of this. Sterotyping gone.Guns gone. The street will be safe for the USA. Police will be procited if they have killed a unarm person.

<p>We pledge togetherness--- we will not allow ourselves to be divided. 
We pledge to allow our thinking and actions to be guided by love. 
We pledge to bring courage and power into our communities, and stop their flow out. 
We pledge not to be controlled by fear, but instead by our dreams.
